        <h5>How to renovate?</h5>
        <p>Renovate, renew, restore, refresh, and rejuvenate all mean to make like new. Renovate (a word ultimately derived from the Latin verb novare, meaning "to make new," itself a descendant of novus, meaning "new") suggests a renewing by cleansing, repairing, or rebuilding.

        <h1>House Beautiful</h1>
        <p>Everyone loves freshening things up until you go to "checkout" and see just how much our small bedroom redesign is actually going to cost, that is. But you don't have to drain your bank account (or forgo your new decor plans altogether) to make it all happen, you just have to know where to find the best deals. Often, you can find similar items and styles at more budget-friendly stores, if you're willing to do some serious browsing. And some stores even carry the more expensive brands you already love at a deep discount, too. That, and there are plenty of brands you might not even know exist that carry affordable, quality pieces you'll love.

These sites are about to become your go-tos for cheap but quality, on-trend home decor. From the stores you likely already frequent (like Wayfair and Amazon) to stores you didn't know carried home items in the first place (hello, H&M and Nordstrom Rack!), here's where you can score amazing deals on the stylish home decor you've been dreaming of. Consider this permission to redo your entire house, now.

</p>
        <p>There is no other better place in the world, than being in the comfort of our homes. Home is where we learn the first lessons in life.

</p>
        <p>The unity, love, togetherness all comes from a home. Home is the base for every individual and we should thank God for being blessed with a lovable home.
